# MyRose
An interactive learning, touch based, program that "grows" with baby. 

Basically, the features and modules available will be based on baby's age. Some features are designed for the parent and some are designed for baby.

Circles by Mac Miller has always seemed to grab my daughter's attention and calm her down if she was crying. It's weird but absolutely the truth.  
So in my instance, one of the modules I would want would definitely need to be a music player, which would keep my daughter entertained for a bit.  However, she also likes psychedelic like videos and sometimes even the "wub wubs". 

One cool entertainment option I want to add is "random story time" 
Basically, the date is randomly selected. Based off of that date, there are a selection of various stories based in the year that was selected. 

As important as entertainment is, I also plan to add features that help promote learning and intellectual growth. I need to research educational activities for various age ranges and add those functions as needed.  

The first idea that came into my mind was the "Shape Matcher". You know, where you put the circle in the circle hole and the square in the square hole.  This functionality could take full advantage of a touch screen



## Educational Mini Games:
	• Swipe the matching colors and shapes
	• Tap the correct color
	• Tap the correct shape
	• Tap the correct Item
	• More…


## Interactive Stories:
	• Future baby growing up and caring for animals.
	• Future baby growing up to be president.
	• Future baby growing up to be an astronaut.
	• Story about baby's favorite super heroes ( Mommy and Daddy)

## Features For Parents:
	• Track baby's progress.
	• Ability to add custom modules.
	• Ability to change "difficulty" 




### How I will make this:

To be completely honest, I am not a teacher, nor do I have any experience with educating the youth. However, through patience, research, and the help from external sources, I am confident I can accomplish this. 
During development, I will start with the most relevant features for my daughter. She is currently six months old, and as she grows, I hope the program can grow with her, as I add updates and improvements.
